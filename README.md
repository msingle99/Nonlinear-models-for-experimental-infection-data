# Nonlinear-models-for-experimental-infection-data

Contains code related to my PhD dissertation in Epidemiology and Biostatistics.

**Scripts**

- *Two-sample-application-TEMP-FINAL.R*: Main program, which sources helper functions and fits a nonlinear hierarchical model for data from a two-sample infection challenge experiment. The nonlinear model is parameterized to capture, and compare between groups, meaningful aspects of the infection response including peak, time-to-peak, and response duration.

- *Functions.R*: Helper functions that define different types of linear response function and perform post-fit processing and model diagnostics.

- *Functions-simulation-SG2-v1*.R: Helper functions for simulation experiments to test performance of the model.
